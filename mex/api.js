// The Tinder app is a web-based application that uses a server-side 
// API to handle requests and responses from the client-side application. 
// Here's a brief overview of 

// how the API works in a MERN stack:

// The client-side application, written in React, sends requests to the 
// server-side API using the Fetch API or a library like Axios.
// The server-side application, written in Node.js using the Express 
// framework, handles incoming requests and sends responses back to 
// the client-side application.
// The server-side application interacts with a database, such as MongoDB, 
// to retrieve and store data related to the user's account, preferences, 
// and matches.
// The API endpoints may include user authentication and authorization, 
// matching algorithms, and chat functionality between matched users.
// The server-side application may use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or other 
// authentication mechanisms to ensure that requests to the API are coming 
// from authenticated users.
// The API may also include middleware functions to handle tasks such as 
// input validation and error handling.
// Overall, the API serves as the intermediary between the client-side 
// application and the server-side application, providing a way for 
// the two to communicate and exchange data.
