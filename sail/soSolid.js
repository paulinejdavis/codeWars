// SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

// S: Single Responsibility Principle - each module, class, or function should 
// have only one responsibility
// O: Open-Closed Principle - software entities should be open for extension 
// but closed for modification
// L: Liskov Substitution Principle - objects of a superclass should 
// be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
// I: Interface Segregation Principle - interfaces should be specific to the 
// needs of the client
// D: Dependency Inversion Principle - high-level modules should not depend 
// on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions
// Applying these principles in JavaScript development can lead to more 
// maintainable, extensible, and testable code.

// DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself", and is a principle of software 
// development that advocates for avoiding duplicating code or logic. 
// This means that code should be designed to be reusable, modular, and 
// abstracted as much as possible, in order to minimize code duplication 
// and reduce the risk of introducing errors or inconsistencies.

// In JavaScript, applying DRY can involve techniques such as creating 
// functions, classes, or modules that encapsulate reusable code or logic, 
// using higher-order functions or closures to create abstractions, or 
// leveraging existing libraries or frameworks to avoid reinventing the wheel.
